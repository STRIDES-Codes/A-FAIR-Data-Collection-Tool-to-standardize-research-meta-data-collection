# A FAIR Data Collection Tool to standardize research metadata collection

## Introduction:

### What is FAIR data and the ISA model?

**FAIR** data are quantifiable observations that have been made **findable**, **accessible**, **interoperable** and **reusable**.
This paradigm can go a long way to ensuring that data is easily sharable between investigators,
and furthers reproducibility by providing rich, standardized metadata for samples.
The **investigation**, **study** and **assay** (ISA) model is one formalization of FAIR practices,
and defines both hierachical data schemas (XML, JSON) as well as a tab delimited format (Tab)
to fascilitate data transfer and readability.

### What does our tool solve?

While frameworks like the ISA exists, there is a barrier for data generators to compile their data in these standardized formats. Our tool is a Google sheets application which facilitates the collection of (meta)data according to field/domain standards using the ISA data model

## Objective:

Develop a (meta)data collection tool using the Google sheets App framework in order to reduce barriers for data collection and sharing that supports the FAIR data principles.

## How to use our tool:

### Loading an ISA Tab template from schema

### Validating entered data
