# ISA-Sheets or ISA-ATTRACTION

### What is FAIR data and the ISA model?

**FAIR** data are quantifiable observations that have been made **findable**, **accessible**, **interoperable** and **reusable**.
This paradigm can go a long way to ensuring that data is easily sharable between investigators,
and furthers reproducibility by providing rich, standardized metadata for samples.
The **investigation**, **study** and **assay** (ISA) model is one formalization of FAIR practices,
and defines both hierachical data [schemas](https://isatools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) (XML, JSON) as well as a tab delimited format (Tab)
to facilitate data transfer and readability.

### What problem does our tool solve?
Our tool is a Google sheets application which facilitates the collection of metadata according to 
[schema](https://github.com/ISA-tools/Configuration-Files/tree/master/isaconfig-default_v2015-07-02) 
developed by the ISA commons.

While frameworks like the ISA exists, there is a barrier for data generators to compile their data in these standardized formats. 
Through our tool, users are able to generate ISA commons compliant spreadsheets where metadata about investigations can be collected
and continually validated without requiring detailed familiarity of schema structure up front.

Our tool aims to (1) Facilitate metadata collection using a familiar user interface, (2) allow the portability of (meta)data entry to the data source, (3) Facilitate the upload of structured (meta)data to the cloud for easy sharing
